## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`azuread.user.new` injects a new `azuread_user` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    azuread.user.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `azuread.user` using the reference:

    $._ref.azuread_user.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ azuread_user.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `account_enabled` (`bool`): Whether or not the account should be enabled When `null`, the `account_enabled` field will be omitted from the resulting object.

### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`azuread.user.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `user`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [azuread.user.new](#fn-usernew), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.
