  '#':: d.pkg(name='application_owner', url='', help='`application_owner` represents the `azuread_application_owner` Terraform resource.\n\n\n\nThis package contains functions and utilities for setting up the resource using Jsonnet code.\n'),
  '#new':: d.fn(help="\n`azuread.application_owner.new` injects a new `azuread_application_owner` Terraform `resource`\nblock into the root module document.\n\nAdditionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the\nresource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:\n\n    # arguments omitted for brevity\n    azuread.application_owner.new('some_id')\n\nYou can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `azuread.application_owner` using the reference:\n\n    $._ref.azuread_application_owner.some_id.get('id')\n\nThis is the same as directly entering `\"${ azuread_application_owner.some_id.id }\"` as the value.\n\nNOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,\nor `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.\n\n**Args**:\n  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.\n  - `application_id` (`string`): The resource ID of the application to which the owner should be added\n  - `owner_object_id` (`string`): Object ID of the principal that will be granted ownership of the application\n  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [azuread.application_owner.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.\n\n**Returns**:\n- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.\n", args=[]),
